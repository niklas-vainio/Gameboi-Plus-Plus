# Gameboi-Plus-Plus
It's been 6 years... can I make a better one?

# Installation

# Building and Running
To compile everything, run:
```
make
```
This will generate a build folder containing an executable `gameboi++`. This can be run manually with `build/gameboi++`, or by running:
```
make run
```

To compile and run with arguments, run:
```
make run ARGS="args here"
```


To remove the build folder and clean everything, run:
```
make clean
```

# Formatting
To format all files in the codebase, run `scripts/format_all.sh`
